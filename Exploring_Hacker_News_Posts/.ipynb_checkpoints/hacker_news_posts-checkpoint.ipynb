    "# Hacker News Posts Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this small project, we will investigate a [Hacker News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) from Kaggle. As detailed on Kaggle, this dataset includes all posts from the 12-month period of September 26 2015-2016. Post data include the number of points/upvotes and comments at time of the data scrape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will investigate two main questions:\n",
    "1. Do \"Ask HN\" or \"Show HN\" posts receive more comments?\n",
    " - \"Ask HN\" posts are submitted by users asking the Hacker News Community a specific question, whereas \"Show HN\" posts highlight something of interest to the community\n",
    "2. Do posts created at a certain date/time receive more comments?\n",

    "The second last post in the above printout has 868 comments! Without this post, Ask HN posts occurring between 2am to 3am have 1381-868=513 comments, which is much closer in-line with the number of comment data for other hours. The 868-comment post can be found [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11694277). Looking at some of the top comments, we can see that they are made throughout the day and not just shortly after 2am, and some follow-up responses are made days later. It seems that this general question trended to the HN community, rather than following in-line with a hypothesis about posts of a particular nature being made around the 2am time."
